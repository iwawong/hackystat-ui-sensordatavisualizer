# 1.0 Introduction #

Today’s organizations are overwhelmed with data. The greatest challenge is how to access
the data, analyze it and deliver the resulting information quickly and effectively
to decision makers so appropriate actions can be taken.

Visualization of HackyStat data is a web-based interactive visualization tool for any HackyStat server. It allows Hackystat users to toggle back and forth in different units of time to view of the development pattern of users over time. For many organizations, the data needed to answer key questions lies in disparate data sources. This project is built using Actionscript 3 and Flare to enhance the efficiency of delivering the information collected during the development process.It is an interesting area to be further explored by it is difficult to provide self-sufficiency to users so that the organization can leverage all key information assets.

# 2.0 Project Purpose #
  * Allows HackyStat server administrators have a overview of all users’ performances over time, allowing them to make better management decisions.
  * Allows HackyStat users to have a better visual analysis of the data pattern at different times, which in turn allows them to understand themselves better and set more reasonable milestones for themselves.


# 2.1 Project Goal #
  * Talk to a HackyStat Server
  * Fetch data from a HackyStat Server
  * Analyze the data to extract useful information
  * Feed the data into charts or other similar forms for visualization
